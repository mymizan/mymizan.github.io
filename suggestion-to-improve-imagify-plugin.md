Today, while I was applying for a job post at [WP Media](https://wp-media.me), I wanted to try their plugins first, to learn more about the company.

I do my due research before I apply for a job. The best way is to learn about a company is to try their products and read their blogs.

WP Media doesn't have a blog, where they post about their company culture, but with a little bit of googling, I was able to learn about their company culture, team, their transparency. and the salary grid from the job link. I became very interested to work for the company. Because I like companies that built on openness and transparency at the heart. It means there will be less bureaucracy and more meaningful work done while keeping everyone happy and productive.

I didn't have access to their paid plugin, though I wish I had; so I started by installing their free plugin, [Imagify](https://imagify.io) on a test blog.

## Setting up Imagify

Setting up Imagify was a piece of cake. I installed it from the plugin repository, just like other plugins.

Upon activation, I was shown a big banner at the top of the admin dashboard with options to set up the plugin.

The design of the banner separates the plugin from the rest of the pack and clearly gives you an idea of what work went behind making this one. I like the minimalism and the cleanliness of the design.

As shown in the step 1, I entered my email address and it mailed an API key.

I do have to admit that they email was a bit confusing. I clicked on the first linked that my eyes caught and was expecting the API key there. Alas! It was sent along with the email at the bottom, which my eyes skipped.

> We don't read we scan

So I didn't even look at the bottom of the email for the API key. I didn't even notice the login credentials that were included in the email. However, after I failed to get it from the link, I came back to the email and eventually found it!

**I do think that the experience here could be improved. Because we know that people don't read emails, they scan quickly and hastily click the first link they find. So the email could have been designed in a way that made the API key more visible. Not that it's a huge trouble, but its a little improvement and a little less frustration for users like me (who are always in a hurry).**

## Entering the API Key

So, I entered the API key that I received in the email and I was shown a nice message with confirming the validity of my license key. That was nice! The animation was subtle, just like the rest of the plugin. You rarely see any WordPress plugin giving such nice feedback to the user to confirm their action. There's no doubt a skilled UX designer designed it.

**However, after I clicked "OK" on the confirmation, it remained on the same page and the same setup banner stayed there. Had the plugin reloaded the page immediately and hid the setup banner (obviously because the setup was done), it would have been very nice.**

## Interface

The interface is well-designed and clean, I don't have a single complain about it. It's so swift and easy to use. The description, help-tips beside each option makes it very clear to the user what is what.

Now the plugin does have self-promotion, but those options are placed at the far right not to distract the user, unlike many other plugins. It won't even show the paid plans unless necessary. Overall, I am impressed by the design and the ease of use. This is something I won't hesitate twice to pay for.

## Image Performance

I have reviewed image performance in a separate youtube video. Please have a look.

## Conclusion

Overall, this is the best image optimization plugin available for WordPress. I am so excited and I am sending my job application right away!
